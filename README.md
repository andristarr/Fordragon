# Fordragon

### Currently under heavy refactoring

A naive implementation of an MMO backend and its tooling eco-system.

## Components

_Being added based on where development is currently_

#### Runner
The Runner is the heart of the Fordragon MMO backend architecture. It is responsible for initializing the core server components and orchestrating the serverâ€™s main event loop. It uses a configurable tick-based scheduler, and wires together the packet sender and receiver subsystems. It manages the lifecycle of the server, ensuring that all systems are properly initialized and ran in the correct order.

Uses bevy_ecs to manage game state and systems efficiently, enabling scalable and modular gameplay logic. For network communication, it utilizes a UdpSocket to send and receive packets between the server and connected clients, supporting real-time multiplayer interactions.

#### Mock Client
The Mock Client is a crude testing utility designed to simulate a game client for the Fordragon MMO backend. The mock client establishes a UDP connection to the server and periodically sends batches of (for now only) spawn packets.
